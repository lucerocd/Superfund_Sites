Environmental Racism in the United States

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the correlation between counties with a sizable African American population and EPA Superfund sites in the area. This correlation is the result of racist city planning policies which would put hazardous industries near low-income and minority neighborhoods. 

The point data for this application came from the EPA's "Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) Where You Live Map" page and it is available at the link provided in the map. The polygon data for this map comes from NASA EarthData's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center and is entitled "Georeferenced U.S. County-Level Population Projections, Total and by Sex, Race and Age, Based on the SSPs, v1 (2020 – 2100)". This data provided population estimates at the county level which the map maker then used in the symbology. 

The symbolization of this application starts with a choropleth map starting from light colors to indicate the number of Afircan Americans in the county. On top of the chloropleth map, I overlaid point symbols representing the EPA's Superfund sites with different colors to indicate its current status.

The design of this application is based off principles learned from lecture 11 of Web Mapping into the construction and styling of interactive bivariate maps.
